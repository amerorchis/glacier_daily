This module determines the season based on a given or current date.
Seasons are defined as:
    - Winter: December 1 - March 31
    - Spring: April 1 - June 30
    - Summer: July 1 - September 30
    - Fall: October 1 - November 30
Note: this is to figure out which template theme to use and so it goes
by the vibe in GNP, not the actual season dates.
